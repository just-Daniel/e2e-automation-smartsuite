[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/r9neq9l08xo77w64?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hdorgeval/playwright-fluent-ts-cucumber6-starter)

Starter project to write E2E tests with `cucumber-js` and `playwright-fluent` in TypeScript language.

_!!! Use this template only with `cucumber-js v6`: do not update cucumber-js dependencies to the v7 versions. If you want to use `cucumber-js v7` please use this [template](https://github.com/hdorgeval/playwright-fluent-ts-cucumber7-starter) !!!_

## After cloning the repo

- run the command `npm install`.

## To execute the tests locally

- run the command `npm test`.
  - tests will run by default with the chromium version installed by `playwright`

## To execute the tests on a specific browser

- to run the tests with `webkit` : `npm run test-webkit`
- to run the tests with `firefox` : `npm run test-firefox`
- to run the tests with `chrome` : `npm run test-chrome`

## To debug a scenario in Visual Studio Code

- tag the scenario with `@debug`
- set the breakpoints in the typescript code
- Start debugging

## To run only specific scenarios

- tag the scenario(s) with `@only`
- run script:

```sh
npm run only
```

## To run scenarios in headfull/live mode

- tag the scenario(s) with `@live`
- run script:

```sh
npm run live
```

The browser will stay opened at the end of the tests execution.

## To ignore a scenario

- tag the scenario with `@ignore`

## To check for typescript, linting and gherkin errors

- run the command `npm run build`.

## To view the html report of the last run

- run the command `npm run report`.
- the HTML report will automatically include:
  - a screenshot whenever an error occured,
  - all page errors (uncaught exceptions in the console) if any
  - all failed requests if any
  - the last ten requests

## To view the steps usage

- run the command `npm run steps-usage`.

## To create a new step

- first write the Given/When/Then sentence:

  ```gherkin
  Given I push "foo" on "bar"
  ```

- tag the scenario with `@live` and save the feature file.

- run the npm script:

  ```sh
  npm run snippets
  ```

- the script will report the missing step(s): you just need to copy and paste them in the step definitions file:

  ```sh
  Given('I push {string} on {string}', async function (string, string2) {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    return 'pending';
  });
  ```

## To use a custom option on the CLI

- add your custom option to the CLI that starts cucumber:

```sh
./node_modules/.bin/cucumber-js features/**/*.feature --foo=bar
```

- use it at runtime:

```js
if (this.cliArgs.foo === "bar") {
  // custom code for option --foo=bar
}
```

## To use a custom World Objet

- cutomize the given Custom World Object : [custom-world](world/custom-world.ts)
